Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Linguistics at the University of Michigan. I earned my B.A. in Psychology and Linguistics from New York University, where I worked in the [Neurolinguistics Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/) under the supervision of [Dr. Liina Pylkk√§nen](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/mariliina-pylkkanen.html). My research focused on the top-down role of grammatical structures in code-switching sentence processing. This project combined both behavioral approach and MEG to explore how bilinguals process mixed-language sentences and integrate syntactic and lexical information in code-switching contexts, with an aim to provide new insights into how the bilingual mind navigates multiple linguistic systems.

Now at Michigan, although I am still exploring my options, I plan to shift my focus from sentence processing to sentence planning in bilingual code-switching production. My research will explore how bilingual speakers build up grammatical structures while switching between languages during real-time communication. Collaborating with the [Computational Neurolinguistics Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/cnllab/), I aim to connect psycholinguistic, neurolinguistic, and computational approaches to better understand the mechanisms underlying bilingual language use.
